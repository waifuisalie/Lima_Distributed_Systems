### Next Steps for Test Preparation

1. **Read STUDY_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive coverage of all topics
2. **Practice with PRACTICE_QUIZ.md** - Test yourself on key concepts
3. **Review your lab implementations** - Be ready to explain design decisions
4. **Focus on priority topics**:
   - etcd/Zookeeper (TDE connection)
   - CORBA IDL â†’ Stubs/Skeleton â†’ IOR
   - SOAP vs REST trade-offs
   - Socket fundamentals (everything builds on this)
   - Heterogeneity and interoperability concepts
5. **Prepare for question types**:
   - Conceptual (why, when, trade-offs)
   - Comparison (CORBA vs WS, SOAP vs REST, parallel vs distributed)
   - Implementation (explain your lab work)
   - Big picture (evolution of technologies)

### Key Takeaways to Memorize

1. **4 socket values**: Client IP/port + Server IP/port
2. **Heterogeneity** is the problem, **Interoperability** is the solution
3. **Stub = Client-side**, **Skeleton = Server-side**
4. **WSDL = SOAP's IDL**
5. **TRANSIENT** IOR dies with server, **PERSISTENT** survives
6. **CRUD**: GET (read), POST (create), PATCH (partial), PUT (replace), DELETE (delete)
7. **Each REST resource NEEDS its own URL**
8. **etcd/Zookeeper** for distributed coordination (TDE focus!)
9. **Middleware solves**: protocols, serialization, endianness, framing
10. **SOAP = letter** (formal, verbose), **REST = postcard** (simple, lightweight)
11. **Web Services as glue** for heterogeneous backend systems
12. **Everything runs on sockets** underneath!

Good luck on your test! ðŸŽ“
